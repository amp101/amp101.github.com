<div class="entry-content"><p>IMDB Rating: 7.8/10</p>

<p>Cast of characters:</p>

<p>Jack Nicholson as Melvin Udall<br/>
Helen Hunt as Caroll Connelly  <br/>
Greg Kinnear as Simon Bishop</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This movie is a touching comedy about three New Yorkers, three unhappy people, who have been condemned by destiny to be whacked and slapped more often than what would be their fair share. It is about a writer (Udall), who has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). He is mean, angry and frustrated; but writes romantic stories for a living. It is about this diffident, young homosexual painter (Simon), who has a strange kind of honesty about him. And a not so young, single mother (Caroll) who has somewhere lost herself between nursing an acutely ill son and working as a waitress.</p>

<h2>The First Scene</h2>

<p>Simon’s ill-mannered pooch is contemplating blasphemy at the corner of a wall with a hind leg raised in the air, outside the front door of Udall’s apartment. This certainly does not go well with Udall. He discourages the dog in his characteristic mean and threatening manner, talking and smiling to him, inviting the dog to join him in the elevator, perhaps to dispose him off in the bustle of the mean city outside. The dog is not easily convinced. Udall picks him up, and the pooch takes advantage of his elevated position to do what Udall dreads. A disgusted Udall, enraged with the dog’s audacity, pushes him down the garbage chute; a smug smile adorns his countenance as he naively thinks that he has rid himself of this nuisance forever.</p>

<h2>Udall</h2>

<p>He is a queer character. He does not walk in a straight line, but chooses to dodge imaginary lines on the floor beneath. He, as the rest of the world, does not simply switch on the light, or lock the door. He will switch the light on and off five times – on, off, on, off and finally, on. Ditto for the lock. The cabinet above his washbasin is stacked with dozens of newly packed soap bars. He washes his hands with two new soap bars under blistering hot water. An extreme case of OCD; he is in dire need of the services of a professional and competent psychiatrist. At the same time, he is also an extremely popular writer of ideal, romantic stories – painting illusions of true love and companionship - the kind that are supposedly popular with a section of the female half of the species.</p>

<h2>Tragedy in its various forms</h2>

<p>The storyline is weaved around a tragic accident that takes place with Simon. He becomes the victim of a merciless attack, inside his own home, by some hooligans. This not only leaves his face scarred beyond recognition but also unsettles his life. The resulting medical expenses leave him bankrupt. He will have to give up his apartment and studio. His fortunes hit so low that even his own dog begins to ignores him. Caroll likewise has her own problems to deal with. She struggles to treat her son’s asthma and allergy condition which leave him incapacitated. She is frustrated, bitter and tired.</p>

<p>However, things do not reamain dark and dreary forever. This is cinema, afterall. Udall, the hopeless cynic discovers that he has tender feelings for Caroll. He becomes a nicer person. The sarcasm and meanness withdraw from his personality. He becomes friends with Simon. He, also, does something spectacular for Caroll and her son. These three people find companionship, support and love in each other. And live happily every after. <Sigh/>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a feel good movie that&#8217;s supposed to leave you warm and happy on the inside. Must watch if you are a Jack Nicholson fan.</p>
